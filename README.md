# HCI Sample Datasets for Student Projects

This repository contains a collection of curated sample datasets related to **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, intended for educational use. The datasets are designed to help students explore, analyze, and build projects around real-world signals captured from humans during interaction with systems.

## ðŸ“‚ Included Dataset Types

- **Eye-Tracking Data** â€“ Gaze coordinates, fixations, and surface mappings
- **Brain Activity (Emotiv)** â€“ EEG signals, cognitive/emotional state estimates
- **Physiological Signals** â€“ Heart rate, EDA, or other biometric indicators *(coming soon)*
- **Interaction Logs** â€“ Mouse movements, clicks, and other user input traces *(coming soon)*

## ðŸŽ¯ Intended Use

These datasets are ideal for:

- Classroom demonstrations
- Data analysis exercises
- Training models for affective computing or HCI experiments
- Rapid prototyping of user-aware applications
